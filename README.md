Welcome to my data science repo.

### Projects
1. [**heart disease**](https://github.com/Kalebferrer/data-science/tree/main/heart-disease) - predict if a new patient will have heart disease
<br> **Description:** supervised machine learning algorithm - K nearest neighbor (KNN)
<br> **Results**: 82% accuracy

2. [**credit card customer segmentation**](https://github.com/Kalebferrer/data-science/tree/main/credit-card-segmentation) - segment credit card customers based on spend and attributes
<br> **Description**: unsupervised machine learning algorithm - k means clustering
<br>**Results**: Segmented the data into clusters and provide commentary on similar characteristics of each cluster to deploy targetted marketing strategies.

3. [**predicting insurance costs**](https://github.com/Kalebferrer/data-science/tree/main/predicting-insurance-costs) - construct a predictive model for total medical insurance cost
<br> **Description:** predict medical cost to allow hospitals to predict revenue and plan procedures needed by patient population - linear regression model
<br> **Results**: regression coefficients of 'age', 'bmi', and 'is_smoker' and their efffects on charges

4. [**stochastic gradient descent**](https://github.com/Kalebferrer/data-science/tree/main/stochastic-gradient-descent) - predict best time to go to the gym to have no weight time on machines
<br> **Description:**  60,000 observations gym dataset with timestamp, number of people and other determinent characteristics - stochastic gradient descent on linear regression
<br> **Results**: Best time to go: 5-8 am on Saturdays, Fridays, Tuesdays. Busy times are around January (New Years) and August (school semester begins). ~9am, ~5pm, ~11pm are busiest times.
